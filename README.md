## Usage

### Sidebar Panel

Click the chart icon in the activity bar (left sidebar) to open the usage overview panel. This compact view shows:

- Total cost and session count
- Token breakdown (input/output/cache)
- Top 3 models by cost
- Top 3 projects by cost
- Quick time range filter (7D/30D/All)

### Full Dashboard

For detailed analytics, open the full dashboard:

| Command | Keybinding | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `Claude Code: Show Usage Dashboard` | `Cmd+Shift+U` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+U` (Windows/Linux) | Open the full dashboard |
| `Claude Code: Refresh Usage Data` | - | Refresh all usage data |

You can also click "Open Full Dashboard" from the sidebar panel.

### Dashboard Sections

**Overview Cards**
- Total cost across all sessions
- Total token consumption with input/output breakdown
- Cache token usage (read/write)
- Number of models used

**Daily Usage Chart**
- Visual representation of daily costs over the selected time period

**Usage by Model**
- Cost and token breakdown per Claude model variant
- Session count per model

**Usage by Project**
- Cost and token usage grouped by project
- Session count and last used timestamp

**Recent Sessions**
- Individual session details
- Models used per session
- Session timestamps

## How It Works

The extension reads Claude Code session logs from `~/.claude/projects/`. Each project folder contains session data in JSONL format, which includes:

- Timestamps
- Model information
- Token usage (input, output, cache creation, cache read)
- Cost data (when available)

If cost data is not present in the logs, the extension calculates costs based on current Anthropic API pricing.

## Data Privacy

All data processing happens locally on your machine. The extension:

- Only reads files from your local `~/.claude/projects/` directory
- Does not send any data to external servers
- Does not require any API keys or authentication

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.85.0 or higher
- Claude Code installed with session logs in `~/.claude/projects/`
